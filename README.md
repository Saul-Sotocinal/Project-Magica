No assets will be pushed to GitHub. It cannot be run without them. I do not want to share the files publicly.

## ✒️ Description

A 3D Side-scroller where a party of (hopefully) three characters fight enemies using spells and skills that use their health to cast.

## 🕹️ Gameplay

To start, the characters will each have a key that needs to be held down to move them. While holding down this key, the player will have to use the mouse to click on the position they want the character or characters to move. 

All three characters will have a role:
 - The frontline tank who can parry attacks. (Must have)
 - The midline support who can teleport characters. (Optional)
 - The Backline healer who can heal. (Optional)

Each of these characters have unique skills that can each be activated with a different key. Using a skill will make the character take recoverable damage which will passively heal overtime. Upon taking non-recoverable damage, all recoverable damage becomes non-recoverable as well.

If a character runs out of health, they will be downed and can only get up if they are healed by the healer. If all characters are downed, the player loses and will be kicked to the main menu.

The player will have to have to fight enemies that will attack them. If all the enemies in the level are killed, the player wins and will be brought to the menu. The amount of wins will be saved and will work as a multiplier that will give enemies 10% more health and damage per win.
